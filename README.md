# Data analysis
Practical Data Analytics exercise on the sales of a coffee shop in NY.

This exercise was built on a few challenges, which had to be developed from a Real Life perspective, where a few questions had to be answered, namely:

1st - Analyze the results of the first 6 months of this store and its branches. Total revenue, total sales, monthly performance.
  
2nd - Evaluate the performance of the products on offer. Best sellers, favorite categories, daily and hourly performance.
  
3rd - As a bonus, forecast the performance of the coming months, taking into account the metrics of the last few months.
  

The data were taken from Coffe Shop Sales (Avaiable on Kaggle.com), and fully analyzed on Power Query, where I created some new info, like the column to classify the time zones, necessary to know when the shop have more customers, the table weekday worked as a support to classify the days with higher volume of sales and revenue. The dashboard building is very fun part of our work as Data Analysts, this is where we have to creative but at the same time we have rules to be followed, choosing the best visualization is not a mistery, but we have to use the right pattern to the correct representation. Lines and columns charts are great to represent cronological evolution, as pizza graphs are great to show small groups of categories.

The bonus challenge I have used a little help from Chat GPT, I'm still learning Python, so I know there was the possibilily to use concepts like Linear Regression from Scikit Learning library, so merging Scikit with MatPlotLib, we are able to give some great predicts to our clients. Of course a business don't follow a linear development, it have to many conditionals to be considered, but for a simple example like this, it seems to be good. A predict in this case can express what to expect, what to plan.

That was a great exercise to practice my abilities in Power BI, Power Query, DAX and M Languages. And I hope soon develop other, and improve this one too.
